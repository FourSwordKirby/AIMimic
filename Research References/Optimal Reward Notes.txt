reward tuning:

Problem: hard to really specify where to give rewards when the player is not doing damage. 

Reward functions should capture the intentions of the designer and simulate other sorts of ideals with respect to behaviors
-Agents should avoid pooly modeled states due to imperfect information there
-Agents should achieve subgoals specified by the designer
-Agents might be rewarded for learning, that is, actually updating it's held values (exploration vs exploitation)
